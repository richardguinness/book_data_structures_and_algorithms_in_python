I've really enjoyed working through [this excellent book](https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Data+Structures+and+Algorithms+in+Python%2C+1st+Edition-p-9781118476734) by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, Michael H. Goldwasser.

### Highlights

- A [derivatives calculator](./exercises_DSAP_part_04_deriv_calc.ipynb) that takes user input
- An [ASCII barchart generator](./exercises_DSAP_part_05_char_barchart.ipynb) that counts occurence of characters in some text and plots in a horizontal bar chart
- A [river system simulator](./exercises_DSAP_part_08_river_sim_2.ipynb) (which uses `__repr__`)

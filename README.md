I've really enjoyed working through [this excellent book](https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Data+Structures+and+Algorithms+in+Python-p-9781118549582) by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, Michael H. Goldwasser.

Particularly the following were fun:

- A [derivatives calculator](https://github.com/richardguinness/book_data_structures_and_algorithms_in_python/blob/master/exercises_DSAP_part_4_deriv_calc.ipynb) that takes user input
- An [ASCII barchart generator](https://github.com/richardguinness/book_data_structures_and_algorithms_in_python/blob/master/exercises_DSAP_part_5_char_barchart.ipynb) that counts occurence of characters in some text and plots in a horizontal bar chart
- A [river system simulator](https://github.com/richardguinness/book_data_structures_and_algorithms_in_python/blob/master/exercises_DSAP_part_8_river_sim_2.ipynb) that uses `__repr__` to show its workings to the world

    "Here we can see that because our simulation iterates through each position in turn (`for i, position in enumerate(river)` - i.e. downstream), there are potential sequences of events that will cause multiple location changes while it would appear that only one should occur (33 -> 34, 34 -> 35 ... 37 -> 38!). Further, it's possible that a move downstream and then back upstream will occur within one timestep which looks like no movement in our representation (23 -> 24, 24 -> 23). The solution to this is to add in some kind of verification as to whether a particular object has already moved in the current time step, or to reorientate the simulation so that each object is iterated over, instead of each position in the river/list. Another soltuion would be to change the positions of each object after all positions had been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major hurdles in the project was the requirement to use a `list` as the representation of the river. This data structure is a bit limited as lists, by definition, support multiple identical items, so there's no method to identify each objects position without using some kind of tracking mechanism/property, and this got a little arduous and complicated. A `River` type/class, based on built-in `list` type/class would be the solution. This would also allow a neat representation which would improve on my `display_river()` method: simply calling the `River` object would cause a call to `__repr__()` which could return a sequence of `F`, `B`, or `-` as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, working with `None` items within the list was a bit arduous too. A modified `None` type would allow operations such as `Bear + None` which would have made things more elegant: there are frequent checks (e.g. `if target:`) as to whether a position contains `None` to avoid problematic calls (e.g. `None.get_position()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "I also stumbled when trying to keep a record of each timestep by appending `river` to a new list called `rivers` in the hope that I'd be able to view the state of river at differing timesteps by subscribing: `rivers[12]`. This doesn't work well at all, as `rivers.append(river)` results in aliases being established between e.g. `rivers[0]` and `river`, so when subsequently `river` changes, so does `rivers[0]`. Creating a `copy()` or a `deepcopy()` would help, but we'd need to make sure we can easily identify the individual objects, perhaps by exposing the position member data more readily.\n",

    "Effectively, this is approaching something similar to a Turing machine!\n",

    " In this instance, we're seeing a `Bear` spawn another without requiring another `Bear` to mate with! From exploring similar instances in subsequent runs, I established there were instances where objects of the same type were being added to themselves! This would happen if an object was moved, and then a subsequent comparison during the same time-step was processed on the moved object and on the position the object had moved from (in the case that the old position had not been set back to `None`).\n",
    " \n",
    " - Make sure to set the `river[self.get_position()]` to `None` following an operation which moves that object\n",

    " \n",
    "My method of creating a `processed` value for each item that has been manipulated already within a given timestep works quite well: rules like this make the system much more straightforward to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last observation I'd make is how important it is to reduce the complexity of the problem when troubleshooting: by changing the size of the river to just 10, and setting p(Bear) to 0 I was able to drill down (having implemented some debugging logs) and isolate strange occurences."

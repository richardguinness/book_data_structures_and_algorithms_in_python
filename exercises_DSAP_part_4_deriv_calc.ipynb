    "1. Seperate out a function which prepares the polynomial ready for `print()`. This could then easily conceal weird terms like `-4.0*0.0^0.0`!\n",
    "2. Improve type checking. This would allow arguments to be omitted (and hence it wouldn't be necessary to spec eg `x^0` in lieu of `1` on the input)\n",
    "3. It doesn't handle polynomials where there are multiple variables (e.g. `x`, `y`, `z`). So it's not possible to specify the variable to \"differentiate by\" presently. The PolyTerm class could be modified quickly to simply return an empty term if it contains a variable other than the one we want to differentiate."
